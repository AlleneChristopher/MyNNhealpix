- add function to visualize kernels
- check and optimize the reordering functions in nnhelpix/map_ordering.py
- add functions that return the ordering also for higher order neighbour filters
- implement some simple NN architectures
- add names to layers in blocks
- implement more examples
- test?
- in nnhealpix/map_projection.py add the possibility to perform rotate of the image on
  the sphere
- add possibility to work with multiple maps: for example T, TQU, QU

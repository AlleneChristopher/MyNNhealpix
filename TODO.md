# random list of things to do:

- add function to visualize kernels
- check and optimize the reordering functions in nnhelpix/map_ordering.py --> MAURI
- add functions that return the ordering also for higher order neighbour filters --> MAURI
- implement some simple NN architectures
- add names to layers in blocks
- add possibility to work with multiple maps: for example T, TQU, QU
- Implement Convolution on pixel at lower Nside
- Max pooling without degrading but choosing the maximum between neighbours
